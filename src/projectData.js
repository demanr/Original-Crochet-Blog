                fullDescription: `This project was a huge challenge for me to tackle, or it seemed so when I started it. It would be my first time 
                following a more complex pattern, making a proper plush and using (correct) sewing. Furthermore, the fact my instructions were translated spanish 
                introduced some unique difficulties, such as incomprehensible instructions, or contradictory statements. I only realized 70% into the project that I 
                used a yarn type far larger than the example, and as such my plush is a bit chunkier, being forearm length instead of hand sized. The eyes were the most 
                frustrating part, as my one horn was a bit off due to translation misunderstanding, and so the head stiches were uneven on the one side. Furthermore, I 
                wanted to take the plush to the next level, and so I had to make the moving gravity defying yarn strand for Hornet's sewing needle. This posed many issues. 
                As i didn;t have any pipe cleaner, I used two mask wires to create the thread. That was, until it startd falling apart and bending the needle. After that I 
                scavenged my house for pipe cleaners and found a singular while pipe cleaner. With difficulty, I threaded it into the needle, and my plush was complete.`,
                patternDescription: `I used a spanish instruction from youtuber CatalinArte Tejidos to make this project. I decided to add 
                some moveable thread to the needle, which was made by doing single crochets around a pipe cleaner. There were some other small adjustments as well, 
                such as making the dress longer due to using a larger thread (to have a better leg-body ratio) and sewing a line of single crochet into the neck`

                fullDescription: `This whale plush is a gift to Iroise for her birthday. I started it on the train home, and completed it not long after. I contemplated 
                restarting or scrapping this project entirely due to difficulties with having a different yarn size than the pattern (leading to odd proportions), and due to my 
                cleaner colour change strategy making a very odd tightness. I didn't want to frog, and when asking my friend Arian his opinion he said to finish it. I am 
                quite glad I did, as it turned out well in the end. It looks a bit strange when sat directly on a table, as its blushy cheeks and stomach are nearly fully hidden (likely 
                due to my colour changing strategy), but when hung it looks fabulous.`,
                patternDescription: `I used a pattern for this whale, which can be found through this link. https://www.hookedbyrobin.com/blog/amigurumi-crochet-whale-pattern .
                I made a few adjustments to this pattern- I used invisible decreases throughout instead of for only certain parts, and I used an invisble colour 
                change method to make a cleaner seam. This backfired slightly, as it created a small ridge between the colours, but by completion it was nearly invisible. 
                Another addition I made was the spout on top. Using single crochets around a mask wire (re-used from my first attempt at the hornet plush thread) I sewed in the 
                remaining thread from closing the bottom to make it hangable.`

                fullDescription: `This was created as a mother's day gift. Due to my mother's birthday being a few days befpre mothers day, in 
                the past my brother and I have struggled to find an adequate gift. Recently, my brother had covid, and despite the mandatory isolation time 
                and a negative test he was kept home to stay on the safe side. Due to this, I was in charge of both mother's day and birthday gift. When I asked my 
                brother for ideas he told me to "buy flowers" as that is what he normally does, but I thought I might be able to do better. That lead to the creation 
                of this flower. I struggled due to my inexperience with sewing, this being the first project that heavily relied on it to tie the petals together, but I 
                handled it moderately well. The stem was a personal addition, due to the lone flower feeling a bit lacklustre. I created the flower sans stem again for 
                my grandmother on approximately May 11th, but due to lack of images and distinguishing photos from this project, it will not get its own profile.`,
                patternDescription: `To make this flower, start by chaining 60 single loops. Do these slightly loosely, as you will be crocheting into the chains. Chaining by any similar multiple of 4 works as well. After chaining, 
                you can add extra loops in case some are missed. Then, skipping one, do eight double threads in one hole. After those are complete, 
                skip a stitch and do a slip knot in the second stitch. Then, skipping a stitch into the second, continue the pattern of eight double threads. 
                The result is a string of petals, which are then sewn circularly to make a flower. I created a inside portion from a magic loop I 
                sewed in, and a stem from chaining and then slit stitching into every other stitch back down, creating a leaf the same way you would 
                create a petal.`

                fullDescription: `This project was a gift for my friend Iroise for Christmas. It was my first attempt at a plush, and I did
                not use a pattern or follow a video, resulting in its cone shape. Despite its imperfections, I am very happy with how it turned out. 
                It looks "derpy" in the cute way I was aiming for, knowing a smooth plush was unlikely to result from my attempts. At this time, I had no 
                sewing needles, and due to this heavily avoided any sewing. The tail was a line of single crochets from creating the circular bottom, leaving 
                the ears as the only part that needed to be sewn. I wrapped my yarn several times around the front of my crochet hook, trapping it under the notch 
                to drag it through and out of the plush. It was very tedious and slow going, but the method worked eventually. I am very happy to own proper 
                needles now, as it makes this process so much more enjoyable. The rat is approximately palm sized.` ,
                patternDescription: `This is made using solely medium (4) yarn. It begins by making a standard circle,
                which is done by first creating a standard magic ring of any length, and do double threads
                through the ring (it is recommended do 6-8, my example had 8). After the first ring is 
                complete do a single loop through the top of the first stitch in the previous row, and do a 
                single loop through the current strand, and crochet through the tops of the previous row. At
                a decided interval do two double threads into one whole to create a circle. To have the sphere
                be flatter do a row with only one double thread in each previous top. Afrer the sphere has reached
                the desired size begin to do double threads into the previous row but at a decided interval (once
                every 3 is a good starting point) do a double thread through two holes at once (it will have the 
                same amount of string as would appear in a triple thread). For a sphere you make the interval of
                decrease the same as that of increase, but for the rat I needed a cone shape and so that step does
                not apply. For the ears I did 8 single loops and double threaded into a hole 2 down, then did two single
                loops and threaded the closes hole until I had a "U" shape. With the final string I threaded the middle
                parts together.`

                I enjoy fidgeting, and as such having a project to work on while in a group discussion was a lifesaver. Furthermore, when the subject was dull, I had 
                something to put my attention on besides the wall or my phone (which would be rude!). This was my first time making a border, and while the creation itself 
                is a bit lopsided, I find the border satisfactory.`,
                patternDescription: `I am unsure the exact yarn used for this, but it was likely medium. The dishcloth is a simple pattern, similar to a scarf in that it begins with a row of single loops (recommended length of
                    20-28 stitches) followed by triple loops and single loops respectively. For more detail read simple scarf pattern.
                    After creating a square-like shape, you can begin creating a border. This is entirely optional. To do this you begin by doing a triple stitch 
                    into the corner piece you left off at, and then counter-clockwise do single threads into the open holes left on the edges. 
                    Every time a corner is reached you will do three single threads to create a corner. After you reach the beginning stitch of the border 
                    you will tie off the yarn by making a loop and pulling the end through. This can be done through the first border piece or by where the final stitch 
                    was made.`
